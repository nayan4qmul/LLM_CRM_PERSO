Personalized Customer Relationship Management System using Large Language Models

*Leveraging AI for Efficient Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Effective Digital Asset Management (DAM)* 

The project will aim to investigate the potential of enhancing the efficacy of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) users and accomplishing successful campaigns through the integration of a text-based search and command oriented Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution with the digital assets currently at the disposal of the organization. The proposed solution would facilitate the reuse of extant digital assets, such as product feature repository, customer features including customer lifetime value (CLV), images, brands, etc., in situations where they are applicable and produce a ranking based interconnections for better understanding the customer perspective, and necessitate the creation of new assets solely in cases where the requisite assets are not available. Consequently, the cost of generating novel digital assets would be significantly reduced, which would otherwise prove to be a formidable task in the face of the continuously expanding volume of digital assets. 

The integration of AI with CRM systems is an emerging trend that has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, there is still much room for improvement in terms of effectively harnessing the potential of AI for enhancing CRM efficiency. The proposed solution presents a unique approach towards this end, which is not yet widely adopted. The project intends to offer a novel way of addressing a critical challenge faced by many organizations, i.e., the growing volume of digital assets and effectively using it for maximising business benefit. The solution aims to facilitate the reuse of existing digital assets wherever applicable, thereby reducing the need for creating new assets and consequently reducing the associated costs. The successful implementation of such a project has the potential to deliver significant benefits to organizations, such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced ROI. As such, it presents a compelling case for further exploration and implementation. In future the idea can be extended towards content personalization that would enable organizations to deliver more engaging and personalized content experiences to customers by re-purposing the digital assets for each customer based on their preferences and interests, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty, and driving business growth.

To implement the proposed project, the digital assets such as product categories, images, details, etc. need to be analysed and converted into ranked based scores based on the customer interactions. It would be possible to identify and extract relevant information, such as product features, attributes, and specifications, and represent them in a structured format that can be easily queried by AI (NLP, LLMs) models. This would enable the development of more sophisticated language models that can provide more context-based responses when a CRM user queries about a product, colour, design, category, and other related topics such as why not try a new category, next best purchase option and recommendation, etc.

You can calculate the number of churned customers based on the churn prediction and the total number of customers in the dataset. The number of churned customers represents the percentage of customers who are expected to churn.

You can also calculate the percentage of customers who are expected to churn based on the churn prediction. This percentage can be used to determine the level of customer churn in the dataset.

[/INST]

[INST]

The total number of churned customers is the sum of the number of churned customers in each category. For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 20 of those customers are expected to churn, then the total number of churned customers is 20.

The percentage of churned customers is the ratio of the number of churned customers to the total number of customers in the dataset. For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 20 of those customers are expected to churn, then the percentage of churned customers is 20%.

[/INST]

[INST]

The number of churned customers can vary depending on the dataset and the churn prediction method used. It is important to note that the number of churned customers is an estimate and may not be an exact representation of the true number of churned customers.

The percentage of churned customers can also vary depending on the dataset and the churn prediction method used. It is important to note that the percentage of churned customers is an estimate and may not be an exact representation of the true percentage of churned customers.

[/INST]

[INST]

The churn prediction method used can impact the number and percentage of churned customers. For example, if a more accurate churn prediction method is used, the number and percentage of churned customers may be more accurate than if a less accurate method is used.

[/INST]

[INST]

To calculate the number of churned customers, you can use the following formula:

Number of churned customers = Number of customers in the churn prediction category * Percentage of customers in the churn prediction category

For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 20 of those customers are expected to churn, then the total number of churned customers is 20.

[/INST]

[INST]

To calculate the percentage of churned customers, you can use the following formula:

Percentage of churned customers = Number of churned customers / Total number of customers in the dataset

For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 20 of those customers are expected to churn, then the percentage of churned customers is 20%.

[/INST]

[INST]

The total number of customers can be calculated by summing up the number of customers in each category. For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 80 customers in the non-churn prediction category, then the total number of customers is 100 + 80 = 180.

The percentage of churned customers can be calculated by dividing the number of churned customers by the total number of customers in the dataset. For example, if there are 100 customers in the churn prediction category, and 20 of those customers are expected to churn, then the percentage of churned customers is 20% of the total number of customers.

[/INST]

[INST]

To calculate the number of churned customers and the percentage of churned customers based on a churn prediction, you can use the following formula:

Explanation - In a retail domain, understanding top-rated products among customers is crucial for targeted marketing and inventory management. With the provided data model, we have transaction data (df) containing information such as order_id, user_id, item_id, timestamp, and score, where score represents the rating of the transaction. Additionally, we have customer data (customer_df) with user_id and customer_city, as well as product data (product_df) with item_id and product_category. This data model allows us to analyze customer transactions, their ratings, and their associated cities and product categories.

      "- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n",

      "1. In a blender or food processor, combine the egg yolk and mustard. Blend for a few seconds to mix.\n",
      "2. With the blender or food processor running on low speed, slowly drizzle in the oil, drop by drop, in a steady stream. Once all the oil has been incorporated, you'll have a thick emulsion.\n",
      "3. Add the vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and blend until well combined and the mayonnaise is smooth and creamy.\n",
      "4. Taste the mayonnaise and add more salt, pepper, or acid (vinegar or lemon juice) if needed.\n",
